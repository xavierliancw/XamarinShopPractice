# XamarinShopPractice
I wanna learn C# and some Xamarin libraries. Why not do both at the same time with a practice project?

Waffle Badge: [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/xavierliancw/XamarinShopPractice.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/xavierliancw/XamarinShopPractice)

## C# Things Learned:
_Through Commit: c6149061b94bfbabacdc04b68041f9bedbccf3a1_
- Asynchronous tasks
- Asynchronous code
- Accessors
- Reference types vs value types (class vs struct)
- How to generate GUIDs (not just Guid id = new System.Guid() //no, no, no it's not like Swift)
- Some minor things about Generics (I can use them without fully understanding everything about them)
- Naming convention: Interface names start with an "I"
- Naming convention: Private variables start with an "_"

## Xamarin Things Learned:
_Through Commit: c6149061b94bfbabacdc04b68041f9bedbccf3a1_
- Persisting cross-platform data through a SQLite database
- Installing NuGet packages (dead. simple.)
- Some small skills that help find the RIGHT NuGet package out of the myriad of choices
- A single NuGet package needs to be installed separately on every platform (Forms, iOS, and Android)
- How to update the Android Simulator OS through Visual Studio settings
- I'm spoiled because Googling help for Swift is x10 easier than Googling help for Xamarin

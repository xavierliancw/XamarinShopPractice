- Asynchronous tasks
- Asynchronous code
- Accessors
- Reference types vs value types (class vs struct)
- How to generate GUIDs (not just Guid id = new System.Guid() //no, no, no it's not like Swift)
- Some minor things about Generics (I can use them without fully understanding everything about them)
- Naming convention: Interface names start with an "I"
- Naming convention: Private variables start with an "_"
